# Flappy-Birds-using-Pygame
Multimedia Lab Project ( needs to converted into oop code )
This is a really extensive game made using Pygame where a bird needs to be operated using a single space key. Further changes will be made to apply reinforcement learning in this game so that algorithm will automatically learn to play the game.
